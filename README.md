# LCMDB
LCMDB i think can be the answer for many companies that serch to get an inventory of their apps, databases and services.

This project has 4 parts:

  - LCMDB.Core: As a friend with NMap and the project Satlwatertaffy this extract all the servers and ports that you have visibility. Then of the extraction this module request help to his friends to extract some information about the servers:
    - LCMDB.IIS: Extract all the information from IIS on the server.
    - LCMDB.WindowsService: Extract all information of windows services on the server.
    - LCMDB.DataBases: Extract all information about SQL Server databases. (On developing)

All information that this app save is taked as a snapshoot everyday.

This solution is uncomplete by the moment but expect that soon it will be available for a v1.0.
